                <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
            </header>
            <p>HTML is a markup language used for creating web pages. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Tags">
            <header>
                <h2>Tags</h2>
            </header>
            <p>HTML uses tags to contain a variety of elements, containing text, media, formatting and much more. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img  and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Examples of some HTML tags include <code>&lt;p&gt;For paragraph elements&lt;/p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, which can be used to embed images.</p>

            </header>
            <li class = "main-li">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</li><br>
            <li class = "main-li">Cascading Style Sheets (or CSS for short) is a styling language used in conjunction with HTML to style webpages.</li>
            <p>Here is an example of the format used by CSS</p>
            <code>body { background-color: blue;}</code>
            <br><br>
            <li class = "main-li">JavaScript is a programming language used frequently on the web and included as part of most browsers, it's widespread web use has earned it the nickname "the language of the web".</li><br>
